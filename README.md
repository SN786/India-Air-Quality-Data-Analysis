This data is a cleaner version of the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP).
* The dataset contains the following features :<br/>
stn_code : Station code. A code is given to each station that recorded the data.<br/>
sampling_date: The date when the data was recorded.<br/>
state: It represents the states whose air quality data is measured.<br/>
location: It represents the city whose air quality data is measured.<br/>
agency: Name of the agency that measured the data.<br/>
type: The type of area where the measurement was made.<br/>
so2: The amount of Sulphur Dioxide measured.<br/>
no2: The amount of Nitrogen Dioxide measured.<br/>
rspm: Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter measured.<br/>
spm: Suspended Particulate Matter measured.<br/>
location_monitoring_station: It indicates the location of the monitoring area.<br/>
pm2_5: It represents the value of particulate matter measured.<br/>
date: It represents the date of recording (It is a cleaner version of ‘sampling_date’ feature).<br/>

This project is made to demonstrate what we have learned in the the course "Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python" by University of Michigan.<br/>
In this Notebook i used Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn and Python3 to complete project.
